# packslip: a signed release manifest

Version 1. Predicate types `https://packslip.dev/release/v1` and
`https://packslip.dev/releases/v1`.

Author: Jeff Dickey ([@jdx](https://github.com/jdx)).

## Reading this specification

This document defines two predicates: `release/v1` describes one release;
`releases/v1` indexes releases and carries mutable discovery metadata.
Both are signed in-toto statements in sigstore bundles.

For a working example, start with the [guides](https://packslip.dev/docs/).
Implementers should read the [consumer rules](#consumer-rules) alongside
the field definitions. JSON examples use abbreviated digests and commits
for readability; those placeholders are not valid release data.

- [Identity and signing](#names): project names, bundle encoding, and signers.
- [Release data](#the-release-statement): artifacts, resources, and requirements.
- [Discovery](#discovery) and [versions](#versions): finding and selecting releases.
- [Consumer rules](#consumer-rules): verification, remembered trust, and installation.
- [Stability](#stability): what version 1 fixes and what a revision may add.
- [Tooling](#tooling): the reference implementation and task guides.

## Goal

A publisher describes a release once, in a signed document that any
consumer can verify against a trusted identity or key. The document lists
artifacts and their digests, platforms, executable paths, resources, and
provenance links. Artifacts may be archives, installers, bare executables,
source tarballs, or other release files.

The manifest lets consumers interpret the release without a per-vendor
filename recipe or registry entry. It does not prescribe a package
manager, download host, or installation directory.

packslip uses an
[in-toto statement](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/statement.md)
inside a [sigstore bundle](https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs).
The predicate carries the release metadata; the bundle carries the
signature and verification material.

## Names

A project name is a host with an optional path, such as
`github.com/jdx/mise`, `gitlab.com/group/tool`, or `mise.jdx.dev`.
It has no URL scheme or trailing slash. The host is lowercase and contains
at least one dot; path segments cannot be empty, `.` or `..`.

The name is the location and, on a forge, says who may sign:

- `github.com/<owner>/<repo>`: releases and their packslips are GitHub
  release assets, and the packslip is expected to be signed by a workflow
  of that repository through GitHub's OIDC issuer
  (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`).
- `gitlab.com/<path>`: likewise, signed by a pipeline of that project
  through `https://gitlab.com`. GitLab subgroups make paths arbitrary
  depth, so the whole path names the repository.
- Any other host: the vendor controls the domain and publishes a release
  list at the well-known URL below, signed with the key or identity the
  consumer pins.

For a known forge, a consumer derives the initial signer policy from the
project it intends to install. It must also check that the verified
statement names that project, or the same repository under another name
as [Forge identity](#forge-identity) allows. Deriving a policy only from
an untrusted statement's claimed project does not check the user's
intended identity. A forge name can change hands, so it locates the
project; the forge's repository ID pins it.
A short-name alias such as `mise` for `github.com/jdx/mise` is a consumer
convenience, not part of the format.

### Monorepos

A repository that releases several tools names each one with a subpath:
`github.com/oxc-project/oxc/oxlint`,
`github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/buildifier`,
`github.com/biomejs/biome/cli`. Each tool gets its own packslip per
release, with its own `version`, and `source.tag` carries the real tag
(`oxlint_v1.0.0`, `cli/v1.9.4`), so nobody has to guess how a tag maps to a
version. The identity pin is still the repository: any workflow of
`oxc-project/oxc` may sign a packslip for `oxc-project/oxc/oxlint`.

When several tools share one GitHub release, each ships its own bundle,
named `packslip.<subpath>.sigstore.json` with `/` in the subpath replaced
by `-` (`packslip.oxlint.sigstore.json`, `packslip.crates-cli.sigstore.json`).
A repository's own packslip stays `packslip.sigstore.json`. Consumers do
not trust the file name: they read the `packslip*.sigstore.json` assets of
a release and keep the one whose `predicateType` is `release/v1` and whose
`project` is the name they asked for, or the same tool of the repository
renamed. A tool keeps its subpath across a rename:
`github.com/old/repo/tool` becomes `github.com/new/repo/tool`, never
another tool of the repository.

### Forge identity

A repository can be renamed or moved to another owner, and the forge
redirects the old name to the new one: `github.com/jdx/rtx` became
`github.com/jdx/mise`, and GitHub answers for the first with the second.
Once the old name is free, anyone can create a repository under it, with
a workflow at the same path. The name cannot tell these apart. The
forge's repository ID can: it never changes and is never reused.

Fulcio records the IDs in every certificate it issues to a GitHub Actions
or GitLab CI job, from the job's OIDC token:

| Extension | OID | GitHub claim | GitLab claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source Repository URI | `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.12` | server URL + `repository` | server URL + `project_path` |
| Source Repository Identifier | `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.15` | `repository_id` | `project_id` |
| Source Repository Owner URI | `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.16` | server URL + `repository_owner` | server URL + `namespace_path` |
| Source Repository Owner Identifier | `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.17` | `repository_owner_id` | `namespace_id` |

Each is a DER UTF8String; an empty value means the forge gave none. The
repository ID survives a rename and a transfer. The owner ID survives
renaming the owner and changes when the repository moves to another
owner; a GitLab project's owner is its immediate group, so moving it
between groups is a transfer. The IDs speak for a packslip only when the
Source Repository URI is the repository its `project` names and the
signer is a workflow of that repository.

A consumer remembers the repository ID and owner ID of the first release
it accepts, with its signer (see [Consumer rules](#consumer-rules)), and
compares each later release with them:

- **Same.** The statement names the requested project and the certificate
  carries the pinned repository ID and owner ID. Accept it.
- **Renamed.** The statement names another repository on the same forge,
  with the same monorepo subpath, and the certificate carries the pinned
  repository ID and owner ID. Accept it and report the name it was signed
  under. That covers a release after the rename, under the new name, and
  one from before it, under the old name, whichever name the user asks
  for. Signer continuity compares the workflow's path inside the
  repository: `.github/workflows/release.yml` of `jdx/rtx` continues as
  the same file of `jdx/mise`.
- **Transferred.** The pinned repository ID under another owner ID. Refuse
  it unless a person accepts the new owner, as for a signer change.
- **Different repository.** A repository ID other than the pinned one.
  Refuse it, even under the requested name: that is what a name
  recreated after a rename or a deletion looks like.
- A statement for another name with no ID to compare, on either side, is
  refused, as it would be with no pin.

With no pin, the consumer has only the forge's word. GitHub's
`GET /repos/<owner>/<repo>` redirects a renamed repository's old name to
the repository and returns its `id`, and a consumer may take that as the
expected repository ID. It says nothing about the owner, so without a
pinned owner ID the owner is compared by name, and a release from an
owner of another name counts as a transfer. First use is trust on first
use: when the name was recreated before the consumer first saw it, the
forge answers for the new repository, and nothing in the release says
otherwise. A lockfile that records the repository ID carries the pin to
every machine that reads it. A certificate that carries no IDs, from
before Fulcio recorded them, is checked by name alone.

The reference implementation reads the extensions as
`sigstore::source_repository`, classifies a release as above in
`forge::check`, and verifies and classifies a bundle in one call with
`verify_forge`.

## The file

A release ships one file per project: a
[sigstore bundle](https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs) (v0.3). Its
content is a [DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse) envelope of type
`application/vnd.in-toto+json` carrying the statement below. Its
verification material is the signer's [Fulcio](https://docs.sigstore.dev/certificate_authority/overview/)
certificate or a public-key hint, plus the [Rekor](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/)
transparency log entry for the signature. Only an air-gapped key-signed release omits the log entry;
see Signing.

The signature covers the DSSE payload bytes, so consumers do not
canonicalize the JSON before verification. `packslip show` decodes and
pretty-prints the statement without verifying it; `packslip show --raw`
prints the signed payload followed by a newline. The payload can also be
decoded with `jq -r .dsseEnvelope.payload BUNDLE | base64 -d`.
General-purpose sigstore tools can read the bundle; consumers must also
validate the packslip predicate and apply this specification's rules.

## Signing

Both schemes use the same bundle format. Prefer keyless signing when a
supported CI identity is available.

- `sigstore-oidc`: keyless. A CI job with an id-token permission signs
  with its own identity; Fulcio issues a short-lived certificate naming
  the workflow that ran, and Rekor logs the signature. There is no key to
  manage. `packslip create` does this by default when it finds an ambient
  CI credential (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and the others sigstore's
  clients know) or a token in `SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN`.
- `sigstore-key`: a long-lived Ed25519 key from `packslip keygen`, kept
  in minisign's key-file format. The bundle carries a public-key hint and
  the Rekor entry, whose verifier is the public key. For vendors who
  release outside a CI system with OIDC, or who want a stable key their
  consumers pin. Consumers pin the public key, never the hint.

A key-signed bundle may be produced without a log entry
(`create --no-log`) for an air-gapped release. Consumers refuse such a
bundle unless they explicitly allow it (`verify --allow-unlogged`), and a
repository should record that choice per vendor.

A consumer that wants a dependency-free check has one: the DSSE signature
of a key-signed bundle is a raw Ed25519 signature over the
pre-authentication encoding of the payload.

## What a verified packslip proves

A verified packslip authenticates the named signer's statement about the
release. A downloaded file whose digest matches the statement is the file
the signer described. A logged signature also has a verified integration
time. An explicitly accepted unlogged signature has no such log evidence.

The manifest does not establish how an artifact was built or whether it
is safe. Linked SLSA provenance must be fetched and verified separately
against the builder's identity and the consumer's policy. A provenance
URL alone establishes no build level.

Resources from `archive` and `asset` sources are covered by signed
digests. A `repo` resource is pinned by the source commit. An `exec`
resource's output is not separately signed; the consumer verifies the
executable and controls when it runs.

A single release manifest does not establish freshness, detect a
withdrawal, or prevent rollback. Those checks require discovery metadata
and remembered consumer state, as [Discovery](#discovery) and
[Consumer rules](#consumer-rules) define.

`packslip verify` checks the supplied bundle and local files. It reports
signing information, provenance links, resources, and host requirements,
but does not fetch provenance, install resources, or maintain trust
history across invocations.

```

The following rules apply to the decoded release statement:

- `subject` lists every artifact by file name with its digests, plus any
  separate file a resource comes from. `artifacts` carries the same names
  with platform, size, download URL, format, executables, requirements, and
  provenance links. Every artifact is a subject, every subject is an
  artifact or a resource's `asset`, and neither list contains a duplicate.
  At least one artifact is required. `sha256` is required and is 64
  lowercase hex characters; `sha512` is optional and 128.
- `project` is a name as defined above. `version` is [semver 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); its
  prerelease part, if any, says whether the release is a prerelease and
  which channel it is on. See Versions. `published_at` is [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) UTC.
- `os`, `arch`, `libc`, `format`, and `variant` are lowercase words of
  letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `.`, starting with a letter or digit.
  The documented values are the ones consumers know; see Vocabularies. A
  value outside them is well-formed but matches no host and unpacks with
  nothing, so a vendor uses one only for a platform or format this
  document has not named yet. An absent `os`, `arch`, or `libc` means the
  artifact does not depend on it: a universal macOS binary has `os` and
  no `arch`, a statically linked Linux executable, which loads no C
  library from the host, has no `libc`, and a script or a jar has none of
  the three.
- `format` is the archive or installer type, or `raw` for a bare
  executable. Two artifacts that differ only in format carry the same
  build, and a consumer takes whichever it prefers. A vendor must not
  publish two artifacts that agree on `os`, `arch`, `libc`, `variant`,
  and `format`; `packslip create` refuses to, and a consumer that finds
  such a pair refuses to choose.
- `variant` tells apart builds that share `os`, `arch`, and `libc`:
  `fips`, `baseline`, `debug`, `installer`, `source`. A consumer selects
  only artifacts without a variant unless asked for one.
- `bin` lists the executables inside the artifact. Each entry is a path
  from the true archive root, with no top-level directory stripped, or,
  for a bare executable, the artifact's own name without its compression
  suffix. When the name to put on PATH differs from the file name, the
  entry is `{ "path": "bin/oxlint-x86_64", "name": "oxlint" }`. Two
  entries may share a path under different names, which is how a vendor
  declares an alias such as `pnpx` for `pnpm`; a consumer may link or
  copy. A name is the command as typed, without `.exe`: a Windows path
  carries its extension (`bin/tool.exe`) and the consumer puts that file
  on PATH as `name.exe`. `requires.bin` and a resource's `bin` are
  written the same way, so names compare without adding or stripping
  anything. The reference implementation reads an older document that
  wrote `name` with `.exe` as if it had not.
- `requires` states what the host must already provide: `os_min` in the
  OS's own terms (`12` for macOS Monterey, `10.0.17763` for Windows),
  `glibc_min` for a `gnu` Linux build, `libs`, the shared libraries the
  executables load, and `bin`, the commands they run. See Host
  requirements.
- `provenance` holds URLs of [SLSA build provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance)
  statements for that artifact. The packslip proves the manifest; verified
  provenance proves the build, at whatever [SLSA build level](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels)
  its builder establishes.
- `resources` lists what the release ships besides its executables, each
  entry a `kind` and one source. See Resources.
- `notes_url` points at the release notes.
- `extensions` carries what the specification has no field for, keyed by
  who defines it. See Extensions.
- `identity` says how the document is signed and by whom, so a consumer
  can check what it pinned against what it received. For `sigstore-oidc`,
  `key_id` is the certificate's subject identity (a workflow URI for CI, an
  email for a person) and `issuer` the OIDC issuer. For `sigstore-key`,
  `key_id` is the key id in uppercase hex.
- `attested_by` is `vendor` (default) or `repackager`. See below.

The JSON schema is printed by `packslip schema` and published at
`https://packslip.dev/schema/release-v1.json`. It enforces everything
above that a schema can: the value patterns, the semver grammar, the
digest lengths. The validator in the reference implementation enforces
the rest.

### Vocabularies

After Rust's target triples, so that a vendor's build matrix maps onto
them without a table:

- `os`: `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`, `freebsd`, `netbsd`, `openbsd`,
  `illumos`, `android`, `ios`.
- `arch`: `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7`, `armv6`, `riscv64`, `i686`,
  `powerpc64le`, `s390x`, `loongarch64`.
- `libc`: `gnu`, `musl`, for Linux builds.
- `format`, archives: `tar.xz`, `tar.gz`, `tar.zst`, `tar.bz2`, `tgz`,
  `tar`, `zip`, `7z`. Single compressed executables: `gz`, `xz`, `zst`,
  `bz2`. Installers: `deb`, `rpm`, `dmg`, `pkg`, `msi`, `msix`, `exe`,
  `appimage`. A bare executable: `raw`.

A consumer unpacks archives and bare executables, decompressing a single
compressed executable to the file its `bin` names. Installers are listed
so a consumer can hand them to the platform's installer or a launcher;
a package manager that installs into its own directory does not unpack
them. A `.exe` that is the program itself is `raw`; `exe` means a
Windows installer.

Every artifact carries a `format`. Selecting an artifact keeps only the
formats the consumer handles, and no consumer handles an absent one, so
an artifact without it could never be selected: it would claim a place
in the release while being unusable. A vendor whose file name says
nothing states the format outright, and a file that is not an artifact
at all -- a shared library, a header, a checksum sidecar -- is left out
of `artifacts` rather than published as one. The value is not a closed
set; a vendor may name a type this specification does not, and consumers
skip what they cannot open.

### Field reference

Required fields inside an optional object are required when that object is
present. For example, `source` is optional, but a supplied `source` must

## Resources

`resources` describes files and generated content associated with the
release: completions, man pages, CLI specifications, agent skills, SBOMs,
and desktop integration files. Each entry has a `kind` and exactly one
source.

### Source types

After applying scope and specificity, consumers prefer sources in this order:

- `archive`: a path inside the artifact the consumer selected, from the
  true archive root. The artifact's digest already covers it. Only for an
  artifact that has paths inside it, which a bare format does not; see
  Scope and identity.
- `asset`: a separate release file. It is listed in `subject` with its
  digest and the entry carries its download `url`, so it verifies exactly
  as an artifact does. A skill directory ships this way as an archive of
  its own.
- `repo`: a path in the source repository at `source.commit`, which pins
  its content. `source.commit` is required.
- `exec`: an argv whose first element is a `bin` name and whose stdout is
  the file, with `env` for anything the command reads from its
  environment. Nothing verifies the output beyond the executable itself,
  so it ranks last among sources, but for a completion it is the usual
  case: cobra, clap, oclif, and usage generate completions from the
  binary and ship no file. What matters is when it runs, and Running an
  exec entry says so. A vendor with a static file lists it first.

### Scope and identity

Layouts differ by platform more often than by file, so an entry may carry
`os`, `arch`, or `libc` to say which artifacts it describes; an entry
without them describes every artifact. A resource applies to the selected
artifact when each field it carries equals the artifact's. An entry may
also name `artifact`, the exact filename in `artifacts`, when archives for
the same platform have different layouts or a resource belongs to one
variant. That artifact must exist and match any platform scope on the
entry. An artifact-specific entry outranks every platform-only entry for
the same resource; among equally scoped entries the platform specificity
and source ordering below apply. For example, a man page that a `fips`
variant keeps at a different path from the ordinary `tool-linux-x64.tar.xz`
can name each archive rather than claiming one layout for the platform. A
TOML manifest spells this as `artifact = "tool-linux-x64.tar.xz"` inside
`[[resource]]`.

An `archive` entry never applies to an artifact whose `format` is bare:
`raw`, `gz`, `xz`, `zst`, or `bz2`. Such an artifact is the executable
itself, so it holds no path for the entry to name. A vendor that publishes
`tool-linux-x64.tar.xz` beside a bare `tool-linux-x64` therefore needs no
scope to keep an archive entry off the bare one; the entry's source
already says which artifacts it can describe. This bears on the source and
not on the resource, so the same man page may still reach a bare artifact
through an `asset` or `repo` entry.

Entries compete only with entries for the same thing. Two entries are for
the same thing when they share a `kind` and an identity: `bin` and
`shell` for a completion, `bin` and `format` for a `cli-spec`, `name` for
a skill,
`format` for an SBOM, and for every other kind the file name of the
source, or the kind alone for an `exec` source. Among the entries for one
thing that apply to the selected artifact, a consumer takes the most
specific (the one naming the most of `os`, `arch`, and `libc`), and only
then applies the source order above. Entries for different things never
hide one another: a skill scoped to `linux` beside an unscoped skill of
another name leaves that skill in place, and a zsh completion for one
platform says nothing about the bash one. The reference implementation
provides this as `select_resources`.

Within the same identity, specificity, and source type, entries are tried
in their order in `resources`. This final tie-breaker is an ordered list
of alternatives: the first usable entry wins, and a consumer stops fetching
or running lower-priority entries once that need is satisfied. For example,
two equally scoped `repo` entries for one skill try the first directory,
then the second only if the first is unavailable. A verification failure
still refuses the release; it is not a reason to try an alternative.

### Resource kinds

- `completion`: a shell completion script. With a static source, `shell`
  names the shell: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, `nushell`,
  `elvish`. With `exec`, `shells` lists every shell the command generates
  and `{shell}` stands for each in the argv or in an `env` value:
  `["tool", "completion", "{shell}"]` for cobra and clap, `["tool"]` with
  `"env": { "COMPLETE": "{shell}" }` for clap's dynamic completions,
  `"env": { "_TOOL_COMPLETE": "{shell}_source" }` for click. `bin` names
  the executable the script completes; a release with one executable may
  leave it out, and an entry that does is for that executable, competing
  with one that names it.
- `man`: a man page. The section is the file's suffix, as in `mise.1`.
  `bin` names the executable it documents, as for a completion.
- `cli-spec`: a machine-readable description of the executable named by
  `bin`, in `format`. The documented format is `usage`, a
  [usage](https://usage.jdx.dev) spec. From it, the consumer's own copy of
  `usage` generates completions for every shell it supports, a man page,
  and markdown documentation, so nothing of the vendor's runs at install
  time.
  Completions generated this way call `usage complete-word` at shell
  runtime, so a consumer that generates them installs `usage` beside the
  tool. Man pages and documentation carry no such dependency. A vendor that
  would rather not put that dependency on its users' machines ships static
  completions as well.
- `skill`: an agent skill in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format: a directory holding
  `SKILL.md` and whatever it references, named by `name`. From an
  `archive` or `repo` source the path is that directory. As an `asset` the
  skill is an archive of the directory's contents, with `SKILL.md` at the
  archive root or under one top-level directory, which the consumer
  strips as it does for an artifact; nothing else is at the root. With
  `exec`, the command prints a single `SKILL.md`. A consumer counts a
  skill as present only once `SKILL.md` is in place, so a half-fetched
  directory never passes for one.
- `sbom`: a software bill of materials in `format`, `cyclonedx` or `spdx`,
  from an `archive`, `asset`, or `repo` source so that its digest or
  commit covers it. Never from `exec`. A release with one SBOM per
  platform lists one entry per `os` or per artifact's archive.
- `desktop`: a freedesktop [desktop entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/), for a Linux launcher. AppImage,
  deb, rpm, and the Windows installer formats carry their own.
- `icon`: an icon file. A hicolor path (`share/icons/hicolor/512x512/...`)
  gives its size.
- `app`: a macOS application bundle inside a `dmg` or `zip`, by its path
  in the archive, which a consumer copies to Applications. Archive only.

### Fallback and verification

For any one need, a consumer takes the first source it can use in the
order above: an `archive` or `asset` entry, then `repo`, then one derived
from a `cli-spec`, and only then `exec`. Static `cli-spec` sources use the
same `archive`, `asset`, `repo` ordering, with document order breaking ties
within each source type. It ignores kinds and sources it
does not know, so a vendor may ship a `font` or a kind of its own before
the specification names it.

A resource is an extra, and the executables are installed with or without
it. A consumer that cannot fetch one, because the asset or the repository
file is not there or the network fails, reports that and finishes the
install without it; a later attempt may fetch it. A resource that arrives
with a digest other than the one `subject` gives, or a repository file
that is not what `source.commit` holds, is another matter: that is a
broken release or a tampered one, and the consumer refuses it as it would
an artifact.

An artifact with `bin` is something a command-line package manager
installs. A release whose resources include `desktop` or `app` is something
a desktop launcher installs. Many applications are both, and the entries say
so without a category that would misfile them.

### Running an exec entry

An `exec` entry runs a release executable. For completions, consumers run
it on demand when the shell first requests completion, without additional
permission beyond installation. Cache successful output for the release,
executable, and shell so repeated requests do not rerun the command.

Other exec resources, such as a generated skill written to disk, run at
install time only if the user has allowed vendor code to run then. Without
that permission, treat the entry as absent rather than failing the
installation. Consumers may also generate completions at install time
under the same permission.

In either case, run the command with the release's executables on PATH, in
a directory of its own that is not the user's project, with no standard
input, with standard error discarded, and under a timeout of its choosing;
a few seconds suits a completion. `{shell}` in the argv and in `env`
values is replaced by the shell being asked for, and `env` is added to an
environment that is otherwise the consumer's. A non-zero exit, a timeout,
or empty output means the entry is absent this time and may be tried
again later.

## Host requirements

`requires` describes what the host must provide before the software can
run. It uses operating-system loader names and command names, rather than
package names, so consumers can check requirements without a shared
registry. Alongside `os_min` and `glibc_min`, it supports:

- `libs` lists the shared libraries the executables load from the host,
  each by the name the loader resolves: a soname on Linux and FreeBSD
  (`libssl.so.3`, `libstdc++.so.6`), a DLL name on Windows
  (`vcruntime140.dll`), the file name of a dylib on macOS
  (`libssl.3.dylib`). It leaves out the C runtime and loader that `libc`
  and `glibc_min` already describe (libc, libm, libdl, libpthread, librt,
  libgcc_s, and the dynamic loader; `/usr/lib` and `/System/Library` on
  macOS; the DLLs Windows ships), and any library the artifact carries
  itself and finds through its own rpath. `packslip create` reads the
  list from the executables named in `bin`, so it says what the bytes
  say, and a consumer holding the artifact can read the same list; the
  signed one lets it check before downloading. An empty list means the
  executables were read and need nothing beyond the baseline. An absent
  one means nothing was checked, as for an installer `create` does not
  open or an executable that is a script.
- `bin` lists the commands the executables run and cannot work without,
  each a bare name as the executable invokes it (`java`, `python3`,
  `git`; no directory, no `.exe`) with an optional `min`, the lowest
  version that works, compared
  as a numeric lower bound, so `17` means 17.0.0 and later, including
  21. A consumer compares dot-separated nonnegative integer components
  numerically, padding missing components with zero; `2.10` exceeds
  `2.9`. If either spelling cannot be compared this way, the check is
  unknown and the consumer warns rather than guessing. The vendor
  declares these; nothing in a binary says it runs `java`. Only hard
  requirements belong here; an optional integration goes under
  `extensions`. A required command may not be one the release itself
  provides.

A consumer checks `requires` before installing, and what it does with a
requirement the host does not meet depends on whether the executables can
run without it:

- A library in `libs` the loader will not find, a `glibc_min` above the
  host's glibc, or an `os_min` above the host's OS version means the
  executables will not start. The consumer refuses the install and says
  what is missing in its own terms: a distribution package for a soname,
  an OS upgrade. A user may override the refusal for that tool.
- A command in `bin` that is missing or below its `min` means only the
  paths that call it fail, and the user may be about to install it. The
  consumer installs, warns, and names the command and the version it
  needs, as a tool it can install where it can.

An unknown check result produces a warning, not a refusal. This includes
unreadable versions and loaders the consumer cannot query. Select the
artifact first, as [Selecting an artifact](#selecting-an-artifact) defines,
then check its requirements. Requirements do not break selection ties or
silently redirect installation to a different build.

How to check, on the common hosts: a library by the loader's own search,
which is the dynamic linker's cache and search path on Linux
(`ldconfig -p`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), the system library and framework
directories on macOS, and PATH with the system directory on Windows; a
command by looking its name up on PATH, with `.exe` on Windows, and
running it with `--version` to read a version. Compare `min`,
`glibc_min`, and `os_min` as numeric lower bounds using the rule above,
against the command, glibc, and OS versions respectively. A version
probe that fails or has an unrecognized spelling leaves the check unknown.

That is the boundary. `requires` names what the host must have, by names
the OS itself resolves. It does not name other projects, versions of
them, or where to get them: that needs a namespace only a registry has,
and a package manager's install hints go under `extensions`. Two things
this version leaves out on purpose, to be added if vendors need them: a
`bin` entry satisfied by any of several commands (`terraform` or `tofu`),
and a symbol version on a library (`libstdc++.so.6` at `GLIBCXX_3.4.29`),
which `glibc_min` covers for libc alone.

## Extensions

Use `extensions` for metadata this specification does not define, such
as install hints, an end-of-life date, or a build ID. The release
predicate, each artifact, each resource, the release-list predicate,
and each release-list entry may carry an extensions object:

```json
"extensions": {
  "example.com": { "build_id": "20260901.3" }
}
```

Each key names the party that defines its value: a consumer by its name
(`mise`, `pacvamp`), a vendor by a domain it controls (`example.com`). The
value is whatever that party documents. packslip assigns no meaning to
anything under `extensions` and never will, so nothing put there can
collide with a field a later revision adds. The signature covers it like
everything else, and `packslip show` prints it unchanged. A consumer reads
the keys it defines and ignores the rest.

Everywhere else, a consumer ignores fields it does not know, so a later
revision of this version can add fields without breaking older consumers.
A vendor does not use that room for its own data: a field it invents may
be claimed by a later revision with another meaning, while a key under
`extensions` never is. Something many vendors put under `extensions` is a
candidate for a field of its own; when that happens the extension key
keeps working beside it.

## Repackager attestation

A repository, registry, or mirror that describes a vendor's artifacts, and
whose vendor publishes no packslip, may sign one itself with
`"attested_by": "repackager"`. The `project` still names the vendor's
project and the artifacts are still the vendor's files, but `identity` is
the repackager's, and `evidence` says what it checked before signing:

```json
"attested_by": "repackager",
"evidence": [
  { "kind": "apt-release-gpg", "detail": "3FEF9748469ADBE15DA7CA80AC2D62742012EA22" },
  { "kind": "pkgbuild-checksums" }
]
```

Documented kinds: `pkgbuild-checksums` (digests matched the packaging the
repackager maintains), `checksum-file-over-tls` (the vendor's checksum
file, unsigned), `apt-release-gpg` (an apt index signed with the given
key), `vendor-signature` (a detached signature the vendor publishes),
`vendor-packslip` (the vendor's own packslip, verified; `detail` is its
sha256), `github-attestation` (GitHub artifact attestations verified),
`provenance-verified` (SLSA provenance verified against the builder),
`scan` (the artifacts were scanned; `detail` points at the report),
`none`.

A repackager document proves that the repackager published exactly these
digests and checked the listed evidence. It does not prove anything the
vendor did not sign. Consumers rank it below a vendor document, and a
consumer that already holds a vendor document for a project refuses to
replace it with a repackager one without a human's say-so.

A mirror is a repackager whose documents carry the vendor's digests with
the mirror's own URLs and `vendor-packslip` evidence. A consumer pointed at
a mirror gets the same bytes under the mirror's pin and can still fetch
and verify the vendor's document if it wants both.

## Discovery

Publish the bundle next to the artifacts: as a release asset, or under the
version directory of a download site.

Consumers discover releases through a signed list or GitHub's releases
endpoint. A signed list can also record withdrawals and a recommended
version. GitHub projects may supplement endpoint discovery with one.

### The signed list

A signed list is a bundle of the same shape as a packslip, with the
`releases/v1` predicate:

```json
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1",
  "subject": [
    { "name": "https://dl.example.com/2026.9.1/packslip.sigstore.json",
      "digest": { "sha256": "...", "sha512": "..." } },
    { "name": "https://dl.example.com/2026.9.0/packslip.sigstore.json",
      "digest": { "sha256": "..." } }
  ],
  "predicateType": "https://packslip.dev/releases/v1",
  "predicate": {
    "project": "mise.jdx.dev",
    "generated_at": "2026-09-01T12:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2026-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "sequence": 42,
    "latest": "2026.9.1",
    "identity": { "scheme": "sigstore-key", "key_id": "5A0A0B8B9C6D7E1F" },
    "releases": [
      { "version": "2026.9.1", "tag": "v2026.9.1", "published_at": "2026-09-01T12:00:00Z",
        "packslip": "https://dl.example.com/2026.9.1/packslip.sigstore.json",
        "security": true },
      { "version": "2026.9.0", "tag": "v2026.9.0", "published_at": "2026-08-20T12:00:00Z",
        "packslip": "https://dl.example.com/2026.9.0/packslip.sigstore.json",
        "status": "yanked", "status_reason": "CVE-2026-1234" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each subject is a listed packslip's URL with the digest of that file, so
the list pins the exact documents it points at. `expires_at` and
`sequence` are borrowed from TUF's timestamp role: a consumer refuses a
list that has expired, or whose sequence is lower than one it has already
accepted, so a mirror cannot freeze or roll back the vendor's view.

Each entry carries the release's `version`, its `tag` as the vendor
spells it, and `published_at`, copied from the packslip. It may carry
`status: "yanked"` with a `status_reason` when the release was withdrawn,
`security: true` when it fixes a vulnerability, and, on a list from
someone other than the vendor, `evidence` saying what the publisher
checked. A consumer never selects a yanked release, warns when it holds
one, and may shorten its minimum release age for a security release.
The optional list-level `latest` is the vendor's recommended default, as
an exact semver string matching an entry's `version`, including any build
metadata. It is not a tag, range, or per-release flag. A pointer to a
version absent from the list makes the list invalid. Its target may be
yanked or otherwise ineligible; that does not invalidate the list, and
Latest below defines the fallback. `packslip releases --latest 2.8.4`
sets it. Omitting the option omits the pointer.

The list is published at

```
https://<host>/.well-known/packslip/<path>.json
```

where `<host>` and `<path>` are the project name's host and the rest of
it, or `https://<host>/.well-known/packslip.json` when the name is a bare
host. For `mise.jdx.dev` that is
`https://mise.jdx.dev/.well-known/packslip.json`; for `jdx.dev/mise`,
`https://jdx.dev/.well-known/packslip/mise.json`; for
`github.com/jdx/mise`, `https://github.com/.well-known/packslip/jdx/mise.json`,
which github.com does not serve, and the next section says what a
consumer does there. A forge that does serve it needs nothing else.

The reference implementation gives the URL as `list_url`, for a project's
own list and for one another publisher keeps for it (see Lists from other
publishers), and the path of a GitHub repository's supplementary list as
`github_list_path`.

A project on its own domain must publish the list: a consumer that finds
none refuses the project rather than guessing at URLs. `packslip releases`
produces the list from local copies of the released bundles; the JSON
schema is at `https://packslip.dev/schema/releases-v1.json`.

The list separates the name from where the bytes live: the identity is
anchored to the domain, and the artifacts can be anywhere. A vendor with
only a git repository keeps the list and the bundles in it, at paths its
host serves as raw files, and points the artifact URLs wherever the bytes
are, an LFS store included. Nothing about a forge's release API is
required.

### GitHub

For `github.com/<owner>/<repo>[/<tool>]` the list is the repository's
releases endpoint, which every consumer can read without the vendor
publishing anything more:

- A release counts when it is not a draft and carries a packslip whose
  `project` matches, or names the same repository renamed, as
  [Forge identity](#forge-identity) allows. GitHub redirects a renamed
  repository's API and release URLs from the old name to the new one, so
  a consumer asking for the old name reaches the renamed repository's
  releases.
- Its tag names its version, as Versions defines: the version, optionally
  after a `v`, and optionally after the tool's subpath, its last segment,
  or the repository name plus a separator. A consumer lists versions from
  tags without downloading a bundle per release, and on install verifies
  the packslip and refuses it when its `version` differs. A tag that names
  no version is invisible here.
- The endpoint's order and its prerelease flag are not consulted; the
  version says both.

The repository may also carry a signed list, at `.well-known/packslip.json`
or `.well-known/packslip/<tool>.json` on its default branch, which GitHub
serves at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/HEAD/<path>`.
It is signed by the same identity the packslips are, and it is
supplementary: a version it names is taken as it says, yanked or flagged,
and pinned to the packslip digest it gives; a version it omits still comes
from the endpoint. So a vendor touches it only to withdraw a release, to
mark a security fix, recommend a default with `latest`, or list a release
whose tag names no version, and a vendor that never needs those never
writes it. Withdrawing a release
this way works on a repository with immutable releases, where the release
and its packslip cannot be deleted.

Once a consumer has accepted a supplementary signed list for a project,
a missing list is an error, not a return to endpoint-only discovery.
Otherwise removing the list would undo its withdrawals without a newer
signed statement. A vendor retiring its entries publishes a fresh,
unexpired list with a nondecreasing sequence; a user may explicitly
forget the remembered list policy for that project.

### Lists from other publishers

A list need not come from the vendor. A registry, a mirror, or a scanning
service publishes lists under its own host, one per vendor project it
covers, at the well-known path with the vendor's project name:
`https://registry.example/.well-known/packslip/github.com/jdx/mise.json`,
which `list_url` gives for a publisher that is not the project's host.
A consumer configures which such hosts it trusts, one setting per host.

Each entry points at a packslip and pins its digest. The packslip may be
the vendor's own, signed by the vendor's identity, or a repackager
document the publisher signed; either is verified against the pin its
own `project` and `attested_by` imply. The list's signature proves who
selected these releases and what the entry's `evidence` says they
checked, not who built them. A consumer that trusts such a host selects
only versions the host lists, which is how a registry that scans releases
before admitting them, or an organization that curates versions, applies
its judgement without a per-tool recipe.

Such a list is a stamp on the releases it names. A consumer that trusts
one or more stamping hosts treats a version none of them lists as not
released: it is not offered and not installed, however valid the vendor's
own document is. Any one trusted host's non-yanked stamp suffices. A host
withdrawing its own stamp does not veto another trusted host's approval; an operator that
needs one host to control admission configures that host alone. A vendor
withdrawal still excludes the version regardless of stamps. A user who
trusts a vendor outright says so for that project alone, and the
consumer then takes the vendor's document under the vendor's pin with no
stamp at all. A stamping host signs with whichever scheme fits it: a
service that stamps continuously holds a key, a registry that stamps
from a repository signs keylessly, and the consumer pins the host either
way.

## Versions

`version` is a semver 2.0.0 version: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, an optional
prerelease part after `-`, optional build metadata after `+`. Calver such
as `2026.9.1` qualifies. `packslip create` refuses anything else, and so
does a consumer. The tag can be spelled however the vendor likes
(`v2026.9.1`, `oxlint_v1.0.0`); `source.tag` carries it.

Version ordering, prerelease status, and channels follow from the signed
version string:

- Order is semver precedence. A backport such as 20.19.1 published after
  22.0.0 still ranks below it, and range constraints (`^1.2`) have meaning.
  Build metadata takes no part, as semver says. The order of the release
  list, GitHub's or the vendor's, is not consulted. A vendor may separately
  recommend a default for `latest`, as Latest defines.
- A prerelease is a version with a prerelease part: `1.2.0-rc.1` is one,
  `1.2.0` is not. Consumers skip prereleases unless asked for them.
  Promoting a release candidate means cutting the final version, not
  editing a flag.
- A channel is the first identifier of the prerelease part, when that is
  not a number: `1.3.0-nightly.20260904` is on `nightly`, `1.2.0-beta.2` on
  `beta`, `1.2.0-rc.1` on `rc`. A release with no prerelease part is on no
  channel, and so is `1.2.0-1`. A consumer asked for a channel selects
  only releases on it, ranked by precedence. The names are the vendor's;
  packslip defines none.

Eligible means not yanked, not a prerelease unless prereleases were asked
for, and on the requested channel when one was given. A requested version
matches as a prefix on dot-separated components, so `20` and `3.12` mean
what people expect and `1.2.0-beta` means the betas of 1.2.0. A request
may also be the tag as the vendor spells it, with or without its leading
`v`; a consumer matches it against `source.tag` or the list entry's `tag`,
so a user who knows a release by the vendor's name still finds it.
Rollback protection comes from the release list's `sequence`, not from
anything a single release says.

Prerelease and channel metadata are derived rather than stored as
separate fields. This avoids contradictions with the signed version or
editable forge metadata. Withdrawals and default recommendations belong
in discovery metadata, where they can change without replacing a signed
release manifest.

### Latest

An unconstrained `latest` request (including a consumer's default install
request) asks for the vendor's recommended eligible release. Ordering
and recommendation are separate: a vendor may publish `3.0.0` while
recommending `2.8.4`. Exact versions, version prefixes, ranges, and channel
requests continue to use their matching rules and semver precedence;
the default pointer does not reorder them.

Consumers choose a recommendation in this order:

1. Use `latest` from the vendor's accepted signed release list, if present.
   On GitHub this includes the supplementary list. The list must pass its
   normal signature, identity, expiry, and sequence checks first.
2. For a GitHub project without a signed `latest`, use the release returned
   by GitHub's [latest release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release).
   Resolve its tag through the normal discovery rules, including a signed
   list entry's `tag` mapping. It must belong to the requested project;
   a repository-wide pointer to another tool is not a recommendation for
   this one. This is an unsigned discovery hint, not proof of authenticity
   or a sequence-protected recommendation.
3. Elsewhere, without a signed pointer there is no recommendation.

Select the recommendation only if it passes the same checks as any other
candidate: verified release signature and identity, manifest version and
digest consistency, no vendor yank, prerelease policy, minimum release
age, configured stamping policy, and artifact/host eligibility. A pointer
never admits a release a consumer would otherwise refuse. Pointers on
third-party stamping lists do not replace the vendor's recommendation;
those lists determine which candidates are admitted.

If there is no recommendation, or its target is absent from discovery or
excluded by eligibility policy, select the highest eligible semver from
the normal candidate set. An ineligible signed pointer falls directly
back to semver selection, not to GitHub's pointer. Report when a declared
recommendation is skipped and why; if no eligible release exists, fail.
For example, if `latest` is `2.8.4` but it is yanked or too young, `3.0.0`
may be selected if it is eligible. Vendors who must exclude `3.0.0` must
withdraw it or use an admission policy, rather than relying on `latest`.

Fallback does not turn verification failures into missing metadata.
An invalid, expired, rolled-back, or unexpectedly missing signed list
remains an error; a candidate with a bad signature or inconsistent digest
or version remains an error. A GitHub latest endpoint response indicating
no latest release supplies no pointer; other fetch errors remain errors.
Changing or removing a signed recommendation requires publishing a new
list with an increased sequence, without replacing any release manifest.

### Spelling a version

A vendor whose versions are not semver as written picks the semver
spelling once and keeps it; the tag keeps the vendor's own spelling.

- A prefix (`jq-1.7.1`, `release-1.2.3`) is the tag's business and is
  not part of the version.
- A missing patch component is `0`: `4.1` is `4.1.0`.
- Leading zeros go: `25.07.1` is `25.7.1`, and a date `2026.08.31` is
  the calver `2026.8.31`. A date with dashes, `2026-08-31`, is respelled
  the same way.
- A fourth ordered component has no semver spelling, so a scheme that
  needs one is not served by this document; build metadata does not order
  and a prerelease part means something else.

Two releases must not share a version. A vendor whose spelling would
collide, two releases on one day under a date scheme, adds a component it
can order rather than build metadata.

### Tags

A forge release's tag names its version when, after removing an optional
prefix and an optional `v`, what remains is the version, or spells it as
the rules above say. The prefix is the tool's subpath, the last segment
of the subpath, or the repository name, followed by `/`, `-`, `_`, or
`@`. So `v1.2.3` names `1.2.3`; `oxlint_v1.0.0` names `1.0.0` for
`github.com/oxc-project/oxc/oxlint`; `cli/v1.9.4` names `1.9.4` for
`github.com/biomejs/biome/crates/cli`; `jq-1.7.1` names `1.7.1` for
`github.com/jqlang/jq`; `v4.1` names `4.1.0`.

A consumer derives a version from a tag only to list releases without
fetching every bundle. The packslip is the authority: when its `version`
is not what the tag named, the consumer refuses the release. If a tag cannot be mapped to a version, the vendor publishes a signed
list with an explicit version and tag mapping.

## Selecting an artifact

Select one artifact using the following ordered rules. The reference
implementation exposes this selection as `select_artifact`.

1. An artifact fits the host when each of its `os`, `arch`, and `libc`
   is either absent or equal to the host's. A host that does not know its
   libc takes only artifacts that name none. A consumer may add a
   fallback of its own, such as a `gnu` host taking a `musl` build or an
   `aarch64` macOS host taking `x86_64` under Rosetta, but it ranks the
   exact match first and says what it did.
2. With a requested variant, only artifacts carrying it fit; with none,
   only artifacts without one.
3. Only artifacts whose `format` the consumer handles fit.
4. Among those that fit, the artifact naming the most of `os`, `arch`,
   and `libc` wins, so a build for the host beats a portable one.
5. Among equally specific artifacts, the consumer's own format preference
   decides. A typical order is `tar.xz`, `tar.zst`, `tar.gz`, `tgz`,
   `tar.bz2`, `tar`, `zip`, `7z`, then the single compressed executables,
   then `raw`.
6. Two artifacts that still tie are a vendor error, and the consumer
   refuses to guess between them.

## Consumer rules

These rules apply to the complete consumer workflow, not just signature
verification. Consumers must preserve enough state to enforce signer
continuity, no-downgrade policy, and release-list sequences across installs.

1. Pin the identity once. For a forge project, the name gives the first
   pin: accept only the forge's issuer and an identity under the
   repository, and remember the repository ID and owner ID its
   certificate records. From then on those IDs pin the project, as
   [Forge identity](#forge-identity) says: a renamed repository keeps its
   pin, a transfer needs a person's say-so, and a recreated name does not
   inherit it. For other
   projects, pin the public key or identity from a list of pins you
   maintain, or from the well-known list on first use. A list from another
   publisher is trusted per host, by configuration. Never take a key from
   the document itself, and never trust a bundle's key hint.
2. Verify the bundle: signature, certificate chain and log entry as
   sigstore defines them, then the statement's structure, then the
   subject digest of every artifact or asset you downloaded, and the size
   of every artifact.
3. Enforce no-downgrade: refuse a release whose `identity.scheme` is
   weaker than the last accepted one, whose signer changed without a human
   saying so, whose `attested_by` went from vendor to repackager, or that
   dropped per-artifact provenance the last release carried. For a keyless
   signer, compare the workflow path, not the ref: a new tag of the same
   workflow is the same signer. For a renamed repository, compare the
   workflow's path inside the repository.
4. Apply any minimum release age to the log's integration time, falling
   back to `published_at` only for an unlogged bundle you chose to accept.
5. Use the project's release list: GitHub's releases endpoint with the
   repository's signed list if it has one, or the signed list at the
   well-known URL; refuse a project that has neither. Refuse a signed
   list that has expired or whose `sequence` is below the last one
   accepted; never select a yanked entry; skip prereleases unless asked
   for them; rank by semver precedence; refuse a packslip whose version is
   not the one its tag or list entry named. When you trust stamping
   hosts, select only versions one of them lists, unless the user chose
   the vendor alone for that project.
6. Select one artifact as Selecting an artifact says. Refuse to guess
   between two artifacts that tie.
7. Check `requires` against the host before installing, as Host
   requirements says: refuse when a library, glibc, or OS version means
   the executables cannot start, warn when a command is missing or too
   old, and report either in your own terms. Fail on nothing you cannot
   check. Check the artifact selected by rule 6; requirements do not
   resolve an ambiguous selection.
8. For each thing the resources describe, as Resources defines one, keep
   the entries whose scope fits the selected artifact and the most
   specific of those, then take the most verifiable source offered in the
   order Resources gives; run an `exec` completion on demand, when a shell
   first asks, and cache it; run any other `exec` entry only if the user
   has chosen to run vendor code at install time; ignore kinds you do not
   know. A
   resource you cannot fetch is reported, not fatal; one whose digest is
   not the one the document signed fails the install.

## Stability

This document is final for version 1. The predicate types
`https://packslip.dev/release/v1` and `https://packslip.dev/releases/v1`
name it, and a document that verifies under them today keeps verifying
under them for as long as its signing material holds.

Version 1 fixes:

- The meaning of every field defined here. A field is never redefined,
  narrowed, or given a different default.
- Field names and types, and the vocabularies that constrain them.
- The rules that decide which release and which artifact a consumer
  installs: [Versions](#versions), [Discovery](#discovery),
  [Selecting an artifact](#selecting-an-artifact), [Resources](#resources),
  [Host requirements](#host-requirements), and
  [Consumer rules](#consumer-rules).
- That this specification assigns no meaning to anything under
  [`extensions`](#extensions), and never will.

A later revision of version 1 may:

- Add an optional field at any level. Consumers ignore fields they do not
  know, so an older consumer reads a newer document correctly and a newer
  consumer reads an older one.
- Add a member to a vocabulary — a resource kind, an evidence kind, a
  format, an OS or architecture token. A consumer ignores a member it does
  not know, except where a rule here says otherwise.
- Settle wording that was ambiguous, where implementations already agreed
  on the reading, and add examples or guidance.

Anything outside those bounds is version 2: removing a field, making an
optional field required, or changing what a rule selects. Version 2 gets
its own predicate type, published beside this one, and a consumer may
accept both. No revision of this document invalidates a release already
signed under `release/v1`, and nothing obliges a vendor to move.

Two versions are in play and they are not the same number. The format is
version 1, as the predicate types say. The reference implementation is a
crate, a CLI, and an action that share one semver version of their own;
that version may reach 2 while the format stays at 1. The
[conformance vectors](https://github.com/jdx/packslip/tree/main/tests/conformance)
are the executable form of the rules above: an implementation that
disagrees with a vector disagrees with this specification.

## Tooling

The [packslip repository](https://github.com/jdx/packslip) contains the
reference Rust library, CLI, and composite GitHub Action. The CLI creates
and verifies bundles; consumers implement discovery, installation, and
persistent policy around those operations.
