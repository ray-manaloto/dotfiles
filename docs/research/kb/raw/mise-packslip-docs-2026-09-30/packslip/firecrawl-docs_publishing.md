# Publish with GitHub Actions

The `jdx/packslip` action signs a manifest with your workflow’s identity
and uploads the bundle to an existing GitHub release. No long-lived
signing key is needed.

## Prepare the files and release

The action consumes final local files. Complete any archive rewriting,
platform signing, or notarization that changes the bytes first.

Create the GitHub release and upload the artifacts through your existing
workflow. Upload separate resource assets, such as SBOMs, too. The action
uploads only the packslip bundle; a signed URL does not upload its target.

Once those files are on the release, either bring them into the signing
job yourself (a build matrix typically stages them with
`actions/download-artifact` before this step) or let `download` fetch
them straight from the release — see
[Download from the release](https://packslip.dev/docs/publishing/#download-from-the-release) below.

## Keep the action away from release write access

Run packslip in its own job after your build and release jobs. Give that job
`contents: read` so the action can download release assets but cannot change
the release or its other files. It signs and verifies the bundle with
`id-token: write`; `attestations: write` lets the provenance step attest the
matched files. The job has no checkout of the build workspace. A separate job
you control receives only the bundle and uploads that exact JSON file.

Copy

```yaml
jobs:
  packslip:
    needs: release # Your existing job that publishes the release files.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
      attestations: write
    steps:
      - uses: jdx/packslip@v1
        id: packslip
        with:
          download: mytool-*.tar.xz mytool-*.zip
          bin: mytool
          upload: false
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a # v7
        with:
          name: packslip-bundle
          path: ${{ steps.packslip.outputs.bundle }}
          if-no-files-found: error

  publish-packslip:
    needs: packslip
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@3e5f45b2cfb9172054b4087a40e8e0b5a5461e7c # v8
        with:
          name: packslip-bundle
          path: packslip
      - name: Upload the signed bundle
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          test -f packslip/packslip.sigstore.json
          gh release upload "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" packslip/packslip.sigstore.json \
            --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" --clobber
```

This example runs on a tag. If another event triggers the workflow, use its
release tag in both the action’s `tag` input and the upload command. For a
monorepo project, upload the bundle name reported by the action, such as
`packslip.mytool.sigstore.json`. If build jobs already attested every file,
set `attest: link` and omit `attestations: write` from the packslip job.

GitHub’s token permissions apply to a job, not to individual steps. Passing
`upload: false` in a job that still has `contents: write` does not sandbox the
action: an action can access that job’s token even when it is not passed as an
input. The separate job is the security boundary. GitHub does not offer a
token limited to one release asset; the small upload step in the write-enabled
job is therefore part of your workflow, not part of the packslip action.

## Add the release step to an existing job

Use this fragment after those preparation steps in your release job.

Copy

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write       # Upload the bundle.
  id-token: write       # Sign with the workflow's identity.
  attestations: write  # Publish provenance for the matched files.

steps:
  # Your existing build and release steps go here.
  - uses: jdx/packslip@v1
    id: packslip
    with:
      artifacts: dist/*.tar.xz dist/*.zip
      bin: mytool
```

Run on a release tag, or pass `tag` explicitly. By default, `project` is
`github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, and `version` is the tag with a leading `v`
removed. For tags such as `mytool-v1.2.3`, pass `version: 1.2.3` explicitly.
The action does not normalize arbitrary tag formats.

In this compact form, the action installs its matching packslip version,
attests the files matched by `artifacts`, creates and signs the manifest,
verifies the bundle, and uploads it. The output
`${{ steps.packslip.outputs.bundle }}` is the local bundle path. It needs
`contents: write` because its default `upload: true` preserves existing
workflows; use the separate jobs above when the action must not have
release write access.

The action and CLI share a version: `@v1` follows CLI 1.x releases, and
`@v1.0.0` pins both to 1.0.0. By default, the action installs the CLI
version from its own commit’s `Cargo.toml`. Set `packslip-version` to
explicitly override that selection.
`packslip-path` runs a CLI the job already has instead of downloading
one; see [Build the CLI on the runner](https://packslip.dev/docs/publishing/#build-the-cli-on-the-runner).

## Publish a different source commit

`tag` selects the release, but does not change the default source commit:
`commit` defaults to the workflow’s `github.sha`. If you dispatch from a branch
and check out a different release tag, pass that tag’s full commit SHA explicitly:

Copy

```yaml
# After checking out the intended release tag and preparing its artifacts:
- name: Resolve the checked-out release commit
  id: source
  shell: bash
  run: echo "commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
- uses: jdx/packslip@v1
  with:
    tag: ${{ inputs.tag }}
    commit: ${{ steps.source.outputs.commit }}
    artifacts: dist/*.tar.xz dist/*.zip
    bin: mytool
    attest: link
```

Use `attest: link` only when the build jobs already attested these files.
A repository skill resource is pinned to this source commit. The caller must
ensure the commit matches the tag, artifacts, and repository resources; the
input does not fetch or validate that relationship. It changes only the release
manifest’s source metadata, not the workflow’s signing identity or separate
build-provenance statements. Keep any workflow-ref/tag guards needed to ensure
those statements describe the intended build. Workflows that already run from
the release commit can omit the input.

## Add resources and requirements

Copy

```yaml
- uses: jdx/packslip@v1
  with:
    artifacts: dist/*.tar.xz
    bin: mytool
    resources: |
      completion/zsh=archive:share/zsh/site-functions/_mytool
      man=archive:share/man/man1/mytool.1
      cli-spec/usage=exec:mytool usage
      sbom/cyclonedx=asset:dist/mytool.cdx.json
    require: |
      bin:java@17
```

Use paths from the actual archive root, including any top-level directory.
Only include resources and commands your release really provides or needs.
Use a [TOML manifest](https://packslip.dev/docs/describing-releases/#use-a-toml-manifest) when
paths or requirements differ between artifacts.

## Download from the release

A signing job that runs after the release already has its archives
uploaded — a separate job in the same workflow run, or a re-run against
an existing tag — can skip staging them itself:

Copy

```yaml
- uses: jdx/packslip@v1
  with:
    download: mytool-*.tar.xz mytool-*.zip
    bin: mytool
```

This replaces a `gh release download` step and a second copy of the same
glob for `artifacts`: `download` fetches matching assets from the release
named by `tag` (the triggering tag by default) into a working directory
and folds them into the same file set `artifacts` collects. Set both
inputs to combine files already on disk with files pulled from the
release. `token` must be able to read that release — the default
`github.token` already can, including for a release still in draft.

## Release several tools from one repository

Run the action once per tool, selecting only that tool’s artifacts:

Copy

```yaml
- uses: jdx/packslip@v1
  with:
    project: github.com/owner/repo/mytool
    version: 1.2.3
    tag: mytool-v1.2.3
    artifacts: dist/mytool-*.tar.xz
    bin: mytool
```

This writes `packslip.mytool.sigstore.json`. Nested subpaths use hyphens
in the filename: `tools/mytool` becomes `packslip.tools-mytool.sigstore.json`.
The signer is still pinned to the repository. Consumers match the signed
`project` field, not the bundle filename.

## Publish outside GitHub releases

The signed URLs are whatever `url-base` says, so a release whose files are
served from a download host of your own sets it and uploads the files
there itself; the action only uploads the bundle, to the GitHub release,
and `upload: false` keeps even that local. A project named after that host
rather than the repository also publishes a signed release list there.
[Host releases on your own domain](https://packslip.dev/docs/self-hosting/) covers both.

## Build the CLI on the runner

The action downloads the release archive for the runner’s platform. Where
that archive does not exist or cannot be used, `packslip-path` points the
action at an executable the job already has: a path, or a name to look up
on PATH. The action runs it as `packslip` for the rest of the steps and
skips the download.

macOS releases are arm64 only, so an x64 macOS job builds the CLI with
cargo first:

Copy

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: macos-15-intel
    permissions:
      contents: write
      id-token: write
      attestations: write
    steps:
      # Build the archives and create the release before these steps.
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - run: cargo install packslip --version 1.0.0 --locked --root "$RUNNER_TEMP/packslip"
      - uses: jdx/packslip@v1.0.0
        with:
          packslip-path: ${{ runner.temp }}/packslip/bin/packslip
          artifacts: dist/*.tar.xz
          bin: mytool
```

Build on the runner that will run the binary; the action executes it
rather than cross-compiling for anything. Install the version the action
ref pins, since the action and CLI are released together, and prefer
`--locked` so the build uses the dependency versions that release was
tested with. The same approach covers a platform packslip does not ship,
a self-hosted or network-restricted runner, and a job that would rather
build from source than download.

A matrix that needs this on only some runners can leave the input empty
elsewhere; an empty `packslip-path` downloads as usual:

Copy

```yaml
packslip-path: ${{ runner.os == 'macOS' && runner.arch == 'X64' && format('{0}/packslip/bin/packslip', runner.temp) || '' }}
```

`packslip-path` takes precedence over `packslip-version`, which the action
warns about when both are set. A downloaded archive is checked against
jdx/packslip’s build provenance before it runs; a binary supplied this way
is not checked at all, so the job vouches for where it came from.

## Action inputs

| Input | Purpose and default |
| --- | --- |
| `artifacts` | Whitespace-separated local files or globs. Between this and `download`, at least one file must match. |
| `download` | Whitespace-separated release asset name patterns to fetch before collecting artifacts; joins `artifacts`. See [Download from the release](https://packslip.dev/docs/publishing/#download-from-the-release). |
| `bin` | Whitespace-separated executable names or `NAME=PATH` entries. |
| `project` | Project name; defaults to `github.com/<owner>/<repo>`. A host such as `mytool.example.com` names a [project on its own domain](https://packslip.dev/docs/self-hosting/). |
| `version` | Semver version; defaults to the tag without its leading `v`. |
| `tag` | Existing release tag; defaults to the triggering tag. |
| `commit` | Source commit SHA; defaults to `github.sha`. Override when the release source differs from the workflow commit. |
| `manifest` | Path to a TOML manifest. Its artifact entries join the matched files. |
| `variants` | Whitespace-separated `FILENAME=VARIANT` entries. |
| `formats` | Whitespace-separated `FILENAME=FORMAT` entries, for an artifact whose name does not say what it is. |
| `resources` | One resource declaration per line. Add `@os[/arch[/libc]]` after the kind to scope one to a platform. |
| `require` | One `bin:NAME[@MIN]` requirement per line. |
| `extensions` | One `NAME=JSON` extension per line. |
| `url-base` | Artifact download prefix; defaults to the release’s download URL. Set it when the files are served from elsewhere. |
| `notes-url` | Defaults to the release page. |
| `attest` | Defaults to `true`. Use `link` when the build jobs already attested the files, or `false` for neither. |
| `out` | Bundle output directory; defaults to `packslip`. |
| `upload` | Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to keep the bundle local. |
| `packslip-version` | CLI version; defaults to the version in the action’s `Cargo.toml`. |
| `packslip-path` | An existing packslip executable to run instead of downloading a release: a path, or a name on PATH. Takes precedence over `packslip-version`. |
| `token` | Download/upload token; defaults to `github.token`. |

The provenance step covers files matched by `artifacts`. Files supplied
only through the manifest or a resource declaration are not automatically
included in that step. Include them in `artifacts` if you want the action
to attest them too. A file also declared as a resource asset is recorded
as an asset rather than an installable artifact.

A workflow whose build jobs attest each file as they produce it should set
`attest: link`. GitHub serves an artifact’s provenance by subject digest
whoever attested it, so the packslip links the same URL either way, and the
action does not add a second statement about digests already covered. It
needs no `attestations: write` permission in that case. An artifact nothing
attested leaves a link that resolves to nothing, so `link` belongs only in a
workflow that really does attest every file it publishes.

The action passes project, version, source, and URL metadata as CLI flags,
which take precedence over the corresponding manifest values. Change
those values through action inputs where available.

## Check the published result

The action verifies the local bundle before uploading it. Check the published
release separately: download the bundle and an artifact from the URLs users
will use, then [verify both](https://packslip.dev/docs/verifying/#verify-against-the-expected-repository)
against your repository identity. This also catches a wrong upload, stale file,
or URL that points at a different build.

Inspect the statement with `packslip show` to confirm the project, normalized
version, source tag, platforms, and executable paths. Inspection does not
replace verification. Linked build provenance also needs its own verification;
the packslip verification command does not fetch it.

For a draft workflow trial, set `upload: false` to retain the bundle locally.
This still signs the statement and, with the default `attest: true`, publishes
provenance. Use the [local walkthrough](https://packslip.dev/docs/getting-started/) for an offline
trial that does not contact signing services.

## Troubleshoot publication

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| No artifacts matched | Files must be present in this job’s working directory, or matched by `download` from the release named by `tag`. Download matrix outputs before the action (or set `download`), and check the glob. |
| Version rejected | Pass a semver `version` explicitly for tags such as `mytool-v1.2.3` or `v4.1`. |
| Executable missing or ambiguous | Check the archive contents and use an explicit path or `NAME=PATH` mapping. |
| Bundle upload fails | The release named by `tag` must exist and the token must have `contents: write`. |
| Signing cannot obtain a CI identity | Give the signing job `id-token: write`. |
| A resource URL returns a missing file | Upload that separate asset; resource declarations only describe it. |
| A download fails its digest check | Compare the published file with the final local file that was signed; do not disable verification. |
