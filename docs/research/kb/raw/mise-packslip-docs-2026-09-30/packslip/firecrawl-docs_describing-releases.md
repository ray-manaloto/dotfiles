# Artifact configuration

A packslip describes the files you already build. Start with artifact
paths and executable names, then add explicit metadata wherever your
filenames or archive layouts leave room for ambiguity.

## Choose flags or a manifest

Use CLI flags when all artifacts share executable names and resource layouts.
Use `release.toml` when individual files need different paths, platforms,
requirements, or formats. Both produce the same signed release statement;
TOML is configuration for the generator, not a second interchange format.

## Select platforms and variants

`create` infers OS, architecture, libc, and format from artifact names.
Inspect the result with `packslip show` before publishing. Use these
argument forms to override platform inference:

| Artifact argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/mytool-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Infer the platform from the filename. |
| `dist/mytool.tar.gz:linux/x86_64/gnu` | Set OS, architecture, and libc explicitly. |
| `dist/mytool.tar.gz:linux/x86_64/any` | A Linux x86\_64 build that loads no C library from the host. |
| `dist/mytool.tar.gz:linux/any` | A Linux build that runs on every architecture. |
| `dist/mytool.tar.gz:any` | Clear platform fields for a portable artifact. |
| `dist/mytool-fips-linux-x64.tar.gz@fips` | Selectable `fips` variant. |
| `dist/mytool.tar.gz:linux/x86_64/gnu@fips` | Explicit platform and variant together. |

Use `darwin` for macOS, `x86_64` for x64, and `aarch64` for arm64 in
explicit metadata. See the complete [vocabularies](https://packslip.dev/release/v1/#vocabularies).

Two artifacts may share a platform if their formats differ and they carry
the same build. Distinct builds for the same platform need a `variant`.
Consumers consider only artifacts without a variant unless one is requested.
If two artifacts have the same OS, architecture, libc, variant, and
format, creation fails.

An absent platform field means no restriction on that dimension. A
universal macOS binary has `os = "darwin"` with no `arch`; it does not run
on every OS. In a manifest, `arch = "any"` or `libc = "any"` leaves that
one field absent. Use `portable = true` only when all platform fields
should be absent.

### Check inferred metadata

Inference reads filenames, not your build configuration. An ambiguous name
can leave a platform field unrestricted or describe the wrong target.
Inspect the generated statement and set explicit values for anything the
filename does not establish.

Architectures are read in the spellings Rust targets, goreleaser, and
common release names use: `x64` and `amd64` are `x86_64`, `arm64` is
`aarch64`, `386` and `ia32` are `i686`, and a plain `arm` is `armv6`, the
default of both goreleaser and Rust’s `arm-` targets. MIPS and big-endian
POWER builds, which the vocabulary does not list, are recorded as Rust
spells them (`mips64el` for goreleaser’s `mips64le`). A Linux or BSD
artifact whose name gives no architecture is refused, since it would fit
every host of its OS; name one, or give `any` if the build really runs on
all of them. A macOS or Windows artifact without one is taken for a
universal or x86 build, which both systems run on ARM.

For a Linux artifact whose name does not say `musl` or `gnu`, `create`
reads the libc from the executables it lists: a statically linked build,
such as a Go binary built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, gets no `libc` and fits
glibc and musl hosts alike, and one whose loader is musl’s gets `musl`.
When there are no executables to read, or with `--no-libs`, libc defaults
to `gnu`.

`os`, `arch`, and `libc` describe where a build runs. `variant` distinguishes
builds a user chooses, such as `fips` or `debug`. A minimum OS or glibc version
belongs in `requires`, checked after selection; it cannot break an artifact tie.

## Name the executables

For `--bin mytool`, packslip searches each archive and records the actual
path, such as `mytool-1.2.3/bin/mytool`. An explicit path is relative to the
archive root, including any top-level directory.

Use `--bin mytool=bin/mytool-x86_64` when the command name differs from the
file’s name. In TOML, write the equivalent as:

Copy

```toml
bin = [{ name = "mytool", path = "bin/mytool-x86_64" }]
```

For a bare executable, `--bin mytool` gives its installed command name.
On Windows, command names omit `.exe`; the file path retains it. An
ambiguous `.exe` can be declared `format = "raw"` in a manifest when it
is the program itself rather than an installer.

## Use a TOML manifest

Keep configuration in `release.toml` when artifacts need different
metadata. This example describes a Linux archive and a Windows executable:

Copy

```toml
project = "github.com/owner/mytool"
version = "1.2.3"
url_base = "https://github.com/owner/mytool/releases/download/v1.2.3"
bin = ["mytool"]

[source]
repo = "https://github.com/owner/mytool"
tag = "v1.2.3"

[[artifact]]
path = "dist/mytool-1.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz"
bin = ["mytool-1.2.3/bin/mytool"]
requires = { glibc_min = "2.31" }

[[artifact]]
path = "dist/mytool-1.2.3-windows-x64.exe"
format = "raw"

[[resource]]
kind = "man"
artifact = "mytool-1.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz"
archive = "mytool-1.2.3/share/man/man1/mytool.1"
```

In a CI job with a supported OIDC identity:

Copy

```sh
packslip create --manifest release.toml --out dist
```

For local key signing, add `--key release.key`. In the action, set
`manifest: release.toml` and still supply the required `artifacts` input.

### Paths in the input and output

| Field | Interpreted relative to | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artifact `path` | The working directory running `create`. | `dist/mytool-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Resource `asset` in TOML | The same working directory. | `dist/mytool.cdx.json` |
| Executable path or resource `archive` | The true archive root, retaining its top-level directory. | `mytool-1.2.3/bin/mytool` |
| Resource `repo` | The source repository at `source.commit`. | `skills/mytool` |
| Resource `artifact` | An exact artifact filename in the statement, with no local directory. | `mytool-linux-x64.tar.gz` |

In the output, an asset’s local path becomes its filename in `subject`.
Its URL tells the consumer where to download it. Do not put `dist/` in an
`archive` path unless that directory is actually inside the archive.

### Defaults and overrides

Configuration follows these rules:

- Local artifact and asset paths are relative to the **working directory**,
  not the manifest’s directory.
- Top-level `bin` and `requires` supply defaults. An artifact’s own value
  replaces the corresponding default; it is not a field-by-field merge.
  `bin = []` explicitly declares no executables.
- Command-line artifacts join the manifest’s artifacts. For a path in both,
  the manifest’s artifact entry takes precedence.
- CLI flags override release metadata such as `project`, `version`,
  `url_base`, and source fields. Extension overrides apply key by key.

See [create](https://packslip.dev/cli/create/) for all flags and the
[manifest types](https://github.com/jdx/packslip/blob/main/src/manifest.rs)
for the full TOML input structure.

## Add extensions or repackager evidence

Put custom metadata in a namespace you define:

Copy

```sh
--extension 'example.com={"build_id":"20260901.3"}'
```

Consumers ignore extension namespaces they do not understand. Avoid
inventing top-level fields that could conflict with future spec fields.

If you describe another vendor’s artifacts, declare
`--attested-by repackager` and the checks you performed, for example
`--evidence vendor-signature`. This is a claim by your signer; consumers
must explicitly trust it. See [repackager attestation](https://packslip.dev/release/v1/#repackager-attestation).

## Add resources

See [Resources](https://packslip.dev/docs/resources/) for completions, man pages, CLI specs,
skills, SBOMs, and desktop files.

### Completions and CLI specifications

[Declare static or generated completions and CLI specifications](https://packslip.dev/docs/resources/#completions-and-cli-specifications).

### Agent skills and desktop files

[Ship versioned skills and desktop integration files](https://packslip.dev/docs/resources/#agent-skills-and-desktop-files).

### Scope resources to the right artifact

[Match each resource to its archive, platform, or variant](https://packslip.dev/docs/resources/#scope-resources-to-the-right-artifact).

## Declare host requirements

See [Host requirements](https://packslip.dev/docs/host-requirements/) for shared-library
scanning, required commands, and minimum OS versions.
