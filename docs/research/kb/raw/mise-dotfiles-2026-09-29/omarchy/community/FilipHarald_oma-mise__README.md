# oma-mise

A native Omarchy bar widget for sync activity, tracked-file counts for [`mise dotfiles`](https://jdx.dev/posts/2026-09-07-dotfiles-that-save-themselves/)

## Install

Once the repository is public:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/FilipHarald/oma-mise.git --enable
omarchy bar move filipharald.oma-mise --section right --after omarchy.tray
```

For a private checkout or local development:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FilipHarald/oma-mise.git "$HOME/.local/share/oma-mise"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/omarchy/plugins"
ln -s "$HOME/.local/share/oma-mise" \
  "$HOME/.config/omarchy/plugins/filipharald.oma-mise"
omarchy plugin enable filipharald.oma-mise
omarchy bar move filipharald.oma-mise --section right --after omarchy.tray
```

If discovery has not completed yet, run `omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins` and
check `omarchy plugin list` before enabling. Use `omarchy restart shell` if QML
remains cached.

## What it does

- Shows local mise dotfiles health in the Omarchy bar.
- Displays publish, fetch, and apply ages with full local dates on hover.
- Expands file/checkpoint counts into up to 10 recently changed managed files
  and the 10 newest checkpoint messages.
- Refreshes every 30 seconds, on panel open, or from the refresh controls.
- Starts or stops only the existing `dev.mise.mise-history.service` user unit.
- Copies a fixed, home-scoped review command when attention is needed.
- When mise reports changed bootstrap declarations with no conflicting work,
  offers a two-step confirmed action that runs the complete bootstrap without
  `--yes`, then verifies and refreshes status.

Status checks run `mise bootstrap dotfiles status --json` and a bounded
`mise bootstrap dotfiles history --json --limit 50` from your home directory.
The popup shows managed paths and user-authored checkpoint messages, which may
themselves contain sensitive names. It does not show dotfile contents or raw command
errors, and it does not store status snapshots. Trusted mise templates may execute
while mise checks status.

Starting the watcher resumes your existing mise workflow and can publish or apply
pending changes. It does not change service enablement or mise configuration.

The declaration action runs your complete configured `mise bootstrap`. Unchanged
resources are skipped, but configured hooks and tasks may run again, templates may
execute while checking state, and changed declarations may affect packages, tools,
repositories, services, dotfiles, or system settings. If mise cannot complete
noninteractively, the plugin stops and asks you to finish in a terminal.

## Release notes

### v0.1.0

- Adds compact relative publish, fetch, and apply activity with full dates on hover.
- Adds expandable recent-file and checkpoint history.
- Adds a guarded, two-step bootstrap action for changed declarations.

### v0.0.0

- Initial release of the native Omarchy bar widget.
- Shows mise dotfiles status, tracked-file counts, checkpoints, and sync activity.
- Includes manual refresh, watcher controls, and copy-only review commands.

## Requirements

- [mise 2026.9.3 or newer](https://mise.jdx.dev/), with
  [dotfiles history configured](https://jdx.dev/posts/2026-09-07-dotfiles-that-save-themselves/)

## Removing

```sh
omarchy plugin remove filipharald.oma-mise
```

For a development symlink, Omarchy removes only the installed link and keeps the
source checkout. For a Git-managed installation it removes that installed clone;
save local edits first. Removing the monitor does not stop or delete the existing
mise watcher, configuration, dotfiles, history, or remotes. It installs no
credentials, sudoers/polkit rules, packages, hooks, or additional services by
itself; the explicitly confirmed bootstrap action can apply whatever your existing
mise configuration declares.

## Development

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING=1 \
  /usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmltestrunner -input tests -o -,txt
omarchy plugin validate .
/usr/bin/python3 -I -S status.py
/usr/bin/python3 -I -S watcher.py status
```

Use Qt 6's test runner on Arch. For a live check:
`omarchy-shell filipharald.oma-mise open`.
