# Omarchy CLI [\#](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/115/omarchy-cli\#omarchy-cli)

Omarchy is usually controlled through the hotkeys and the Omarchy menu (`Super + Alt + Space`). But you can also control it through the `omarchy` CLI. This is particularly helpful when you're having an AI agent work with you on customization or configuration.

The CLI has access to all the internal tooling that is used both via the menu and otherwise. You can see everything that's available by running `omarchy` in the terminal.

It looks something like this:

```
~ ❯ omarchy
