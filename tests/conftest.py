"""Shared pytest configuration: the `host_only` CI skip.

`host_only` marks the handful of tests asserting facts about a real
developer host — a host-installed CLI (`claude`, `gemini`) or a
chezmoi-applied `~/.zshenv` under zsh. No amount of `mise install` on a
runner makes them pass, so they are skipped there and ONLY there; on the
Mac host (and under `mise run ship`) they run normally.

Why a hook and not `-m "not host_only"` in the CI step: `pytest.ini`'s
`addopts` already carries `-m "not image_exec and not codex_exec"`, and a
command-line `-m` REPLACES it rather than anding with it (last one wins).
A CI `-m` would therefore have to restate the whole expression, and would
silently re-enable the credit-spending `codex_exec` tests the day someone
adds a marker and forgets. This cannot drift.
